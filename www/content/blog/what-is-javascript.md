I am really impressed here with Kyle's ability to summarize a topic.\
What is JavaScript?

> JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard (version ES2019 as of this writing), which is guided by the TC39 committee and hosted by ECMA. It runs in browsers and other JS environments such as Node.js.\
\
JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, meaning the syntax and capabilities allow a developer to mix and match (and bend and reshape!) concepts from various major paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented (OO/classes), and functional (FP).\
\
JavaScript is a compiled language, meaning the tools (including the JavaScript engine) process and verify a program (reporting any errors!) before it executes.
