{{% image src="bologna-fireworks.jpg" caption="Fireworks in Bologna" %}}

The year is near its end.

After I postponed it for a long time, in 2013 I finally started blogging, and would like
to continue in the future. There are lots of technologies I would like to try, eg. `nodejs`.

My free time in the next months will suffer a significant cut, and I could not be happier. 
In February, I will become father. Me and my wife decided to call our first daughter Chiara.

I'll keep you updated, in the meantime, happy new year.
