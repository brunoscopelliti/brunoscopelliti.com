It's passed more time than I expected since my last post.

These months have been really busy - and even more happy - for me and my family...
we moved to a new house, and most important our daughter Chiara came to light.

A couple of months ago, I started writing a simple AngularJS todo app with the goal of learning
how to write better unit tests (Karma + JasmineJS) and E2E tests (Selenium + protractor).

I was also planning to write a series of posts about this experience, however in this period
I am too busy for this; so I decided to publish the code of the app, and the tests on Github,
[todooo](https://github.com/blog-brunoscopelliti/todooo "Github repository: todooo").
The code of the tests is well-commented, and hopefully it will turn helpful for someone.

If you're interested in this kind of thing
[todooo-mean](https://github.com/blog-brunoscopelliti/todooo-mean "Github repository: todooo-mean")
is a variation of the original todooo app, built on MEAN stack.
