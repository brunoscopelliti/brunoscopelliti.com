From [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), by Marijn Haverbeke.

> Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming. When a program works, it is beautiful. The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity.

Just a reminder, primarily for myself.

As developers we not only have to *solve problems*, but do it in a way we do not harm our future-self.
