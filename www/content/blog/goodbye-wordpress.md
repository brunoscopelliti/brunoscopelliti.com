During last year blogging has fallen down in my list of priorities.

One of my resolutions for this new year is to try to start blogging again on a regular schedule.

Even if I am a huge fan of WordPress, I have to admit that it carries with it a
lot of overhead, probably not justified for a blog like my own. So I decided to give
a try to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Simple, blog-aware, static sites"), and damn,
it was love at first sight ðŸ¤©

Jekyll allows me to work on my blog exactly the same way I would work on a normal project.
<br/>
The code as well as the content of my posts are versioned on GitHub. I use SASS
as preprocessor for the stylesheets, and the scripts do just the things I thought were necessary.
The build phase is automatized by Grunt. Amazing.
