I've published on GitHub a series to help [make sense of WebPack](https://github.com/brunoscopelliti/webpack-101 "A progressive webpack 2 configuration demo/tutorial.").

I'm not going to approach this like *That's the configuration file, copy and paste it into your root folder, and everything will just be fine!*

Instead we're going to build a WebPack configuration step by step together. We need to understand what we want to achieve with every single setting. I won't talk about WebPack in the abstract, or about a WebPack feature as a stand alone piece; instead we're actually going to build a simple single page application, and everytime we'll change something into WebPack configuration, immediately we'll see how this change affects our bundle, and our application.
