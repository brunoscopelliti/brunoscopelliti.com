I am enthusiast to start this blog.

The first post is always the most difficult... so this is going to be a short one; just to say that here I'm going to write about software development.

Recently I started learning AngularJS, and I am really impressed. I finished reading the docs - which are great - and I am going to start my own experiments soon.

**A final note**

Currently this blog is using the Twenty Eleven WordPress theme. Even if this is a great theme, I really look forward to the release of Twenty Thirteen theme; then I will use it as basis for my own theme.
