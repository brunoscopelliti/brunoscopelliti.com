As someone of you might have noted, recently my blog has changed skin - second time in 2016. I've also started serving its content over SSL, and migrated the hosting on Digital Ocean... I think that's a lot that has changed.

I'm going to restart writing here on regular basis, and I've already a list of things I would like to talk about.

Thanks for reading! See you around ðŸ™‚
