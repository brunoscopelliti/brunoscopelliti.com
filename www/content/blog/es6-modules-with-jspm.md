Recently I've been playing with the new ES2015 stuff. One of the things I am more excited about it, is the new module format.

What probably not everyone knows is that it is possible to start using the new module syntax today, with tools like [jspm](http://jspm.io/ "Browser Package Manager") to polyfill the missing loader functionality of the browser.

I published a repo on Github with basic usage examples; it's here: [ES2015 module playground](https://github.com/blog-brunoscopelliti/es6modules-playground "ECMAScript2015 module playground").

In order to run the demo on your pc, you still need node, and npm; then you have to install jspm.
