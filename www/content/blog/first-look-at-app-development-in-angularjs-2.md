A couple of weeks ago David East
([@_davideast](https://twitter.com/_davideast "David East's Twitter profile"))
gave a talk about app development with AngularJS 2.

The presentation was followed by a really interesting QAs session, with the participation
of Mi≈°ko Hevery, and Igor Minar.

This is what seemed most interesting to me:

* AngularJS 2 is built on top of web standards; so no more AngularJS module,
but ECMAScript 2015 module, web components and so on...

* There won't be anymore the configuration phase

* New routing system, with the possibility to lazyload dependencies (probably since AngularJS 1.4)

* Directives will undergo a real boost:

  + possibility to bind to native DOM element's properties; for example `ng-show`,
  `ng-hide` are replaced by binding directly to html element's `hidden` property.

  + web components (with fallback)

  + shadow DOM will replace transclusion
