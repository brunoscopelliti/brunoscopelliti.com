Having recently switched to [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), I often find myself googling
for how to disable a rule on a particular occurrence via JavaScript comment.

Hope writing this will help me to memorize the syntax, I'll bookmark this page otherwise ðŸ˜….

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line no-alert
alert("foo");

alert("foo"); // eslint-disable-line no-alert
```

It's also possible to omit the name of the rule, and in this case lint is turned off for
the entire line.
